      <p class="about-me-text"> My skills lie in creating aesthetic, vibey, and visually appealing websites from scratch, allowing for a completely unique website. I build interactive websites with hover effects, scroll effects, animations, etc., engaging users, and creating a lasting impression. I develop all this from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering full customizability to your website.</p>

    <div class="about-me">
      <h1 class="about-me-header">A little about me</h1>

      <p class="about-me-text">I am a dedicated front-end web developer, and I love programming. With two years of front-end web development experience in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I am still learning new things every day and my skillset is rapidly expanding. If you decide to purchase my service on Fiverr, it is like an investment. I offer heavy discounts to recurring clients, and my skills in the future will be worth much more.</p>
